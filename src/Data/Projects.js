A custom visualization engine then translates this sequence into a live, frame-by-frame animation, showing exactly how data is moved. The app provides real-time performance stats (comparisons, swaps, time) and interactive controls, demonstrating a practical mastery of algorithm analysis and dynamic state visualization.",
